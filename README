Device::Blkid - Interface to libblkid
=====================================

WARNING: This module requires libblkid 2.16 or newer, i.e. a version that 
ships with util-linux-ng (in contrast to older library versions, which
were part of e2fsprogs).

libblkid is a Linux library that is able to probe devices for the file
systems on that devices and other information. Most file systems provide
a UUID, and possibly a label.

"Device::Blkid" closely resembles the native interface of libblkid. All 
functions provided by libblkid are available from Perl as well. Most
functions work exactly the same way, although a few have been slightly
modified to behave a little more "Perlish".


A complete API description is available in the module's perldoc
(perldoc Device::Blkid). Additionally, information about the module may
